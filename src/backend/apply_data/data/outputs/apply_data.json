                "explanation": "This is the correct answer because setting the connection draining timeout to a low value ensures that instances are deregistered quickly without leaving requests unhandled. For applications dealing with short requests, a timeout of 1-2 seconds allows remaining requests to complete before the instance is removed from the load balancer's pool.",
                "elaborate": "Connection draining is important for maintaining availability during instance maintenance or scaling events. By setting a low timeout, you minimize the duration that a deregistered instance can accept new connections, which is crucial when each request is expected to complete rapidly. For example, in a scenario where a web application processes user requests that typically take less than a second, setting a timeout of 1-2 seconds effectively balances the quick removal of instances with the need to complete ongoing requests, enhancing overall performance and user experience."

                    "elaborate": "For short requests, setting a high connection draining timeout means that the instance will wait for the full duration before deregistering, even if it completes requests almost instantly. This not only wastes time but also resources, as the instances keep running and incur costs without serving additional significant traffic. For example, if a web server handles requests in under a second, a 300-second timeout means the instance remains in the draining state much longer than needed, delaying necessary maintenance or scaling operations."

                "explanation": "This is the correct answer because Alias records allow you to point your domain directly to AWS resources, such as Elastic Load Balancers or S3 buckets, without the need for an external IP address. This reduces the need for DNS resolution queries to external DNS providers, thereby improving efficiency and potentially lowering costs.",
                "elaborate": "Alias records provide a straightforward way to link your domain to AWS resources directly. For instance, if you have a website hosted on an S3 bucket, you can create an Alias record in Route 53 that points directly to the S3 bucket's endpoint. This means that requests can be resolved within the AWS infrastructure, thus avoiding additional DNS lookups and enhancing performance. Furthermore, since you are not paying for an external DNS provider's resolution fees, this can lead to cost savings as well."

In the context of processing messages in the order they are produced by each truck, using SNS topics would not be appropriate since it lacks FIFO semantics. For example, if Truck A's message A1 should be processed before A2 and Truck B's message B1 should be processed before B2, SNS cannot guarantee this order, potentially leading to mishandling of sequenced operations."
