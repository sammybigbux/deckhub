["Ensuring Consistent Public Access: Imagine you have a web application running on an EC2 instance that must have a consistent public IP address, even if the instance stops and starts. What solution would you implement to achieve this?", "EC2 advanced"]
["Ensuring Network Connectivity for EC2 Instances: Suppose you need to provide network connectivity to an EC2 instance in a specific availability zone. How would you configure the ENI, including its IP addresses and security groups?", "EC2 Advanced"]
["Deploying a Firewall for Traffic Inspection: Suppose you need to ensure that all network traffic to your application is inspected by a firewall before reaching the application. How would you use a gateway load balancer to achieve this?", "High Availability and Scalability"]
["Configuring SNI for Multiple Domains: Imagine you have multiple domains that need to be served by a single load balancer. How would you configure SNI to handle multiple SSL certificates, and which load balancers support this feature?", "High Availability and Scalability"]
["Recovery of Deleted S3 Objects Your company policy requires that deleted S3 objects should be recoverable immediately for 30 days and within 48 hours for up to 365 days. How would you configure S3 versioning and lifecycle rules to meet this requirement?", "S3 Advanced"]
["Scaling Video Processing: You have an application that processes video uploads, which can be resource-intensive and vary in volume. How can you design a system using AWS services to handle the varying load without impacting the user experience?", "Decoupling Applications"]
["Multiple SQS Queue Subscriptions: You have a buying service that needs to send messages to multiple SQS queues without directly writing to each queue. Which AWS services and pattern would you use to achieve this?", "Decoupling Applications"]
["Tracking GPS Data of Trucks: Imagine you have 100 trucks on the road, each sending GPS data regularly to AWS. You need to ensure the data is processed in the order it was sent for each truck. How would you use Kinesis Data Streams and partition keys to achieve this?", "Decoupling Applications"]
["Scaling Consumers with SQS FIFO: You need to process messages from multiple sources (e.g., trucks) and want to scale the number of consumers based on the number of sources. How would you use SQS FIFO and group IDs to manage and scale this workload?", "Decoupling Applications"]
